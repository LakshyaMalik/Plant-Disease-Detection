# Plant-Disease-Detection
# ABSTRACT
This study presents a comprehensive exploration of leaf disease detection through advanced image processing techniques and deep learning architectures. Leveraging digital image processing, we aim to establish an efficient, dependable, and highly accurate method for detecting, identifying, and classifying a range of diseases across various plant species. Our primary objective is to design an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model capable of analyzing leaf images and recognizing disease patterns with high precision, regardless of plant type. To achieve this, we focus on developing a model that extracts and evaluates distinct visual symptomsâ€”such as discoloration, texture changes, and abnormal shapes present on the leaves. These symptoms serve as critical parameters for distinguishing healthy leaves from diseased ones and for categorizing the specific diseases observed. In this work, we outline our approach to constructing the model, including detailed descriptions of data preprocessing, feature extraction, and the implementation of deep learning algorithms tailored for disease identification.
